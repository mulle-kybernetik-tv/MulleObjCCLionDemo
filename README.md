# MulleObjCCLionDemo

🦁 An example CLion mulle-objc project 

This example project is also useful as a template for new CLion projects. Follow these three steps to generate a new
mulle-objc project based on the "Foundation".

## 1. Generate new CLion project on GitHub

On GitHub [generate](https://github.com/mulle-kybernetik-tv/MulleObjCCLionDemo/generate) your own project with MulleObjCClionDemo as the template. Here we are using "myproject" as the new name.

In [CLion](//www.jetbrains.com/clion/) in the welcome screen or the new/open project dialog 

![Welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38703833/151210307-5280e852-082c-4660-a79e-f4bd1cd10f21.png)

choose "Get from VCS", then enter the URL of your new project:

You may have to trust the project to proceed. In the New/Open Project Wizard that should now open. You
neeed to configure the [mulle-clang](//github.com/mulle-cc/mulle-clang-project/releases) compiler (and optionally
the [mulle-gdb](//github.com/mulle-cc/mulle-gdb/releases) debugger).

![configure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38703833/151203695-9ead8c7b-c56c-4a6a-904d-005f81c06b8d.png)

If this doesn't show up, check "File / Settings / Build Execution Deployment / ToolChains", which is the same dialog basically.

![ToolChains](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38703833/151203967-9f5ce77d-4fa2-4803-9804-a4700d8a6a25.png)

On the "Toolchains > CMake" configuration page, you can leave everything as is.

You should now have the local project opened in CLion. But there will be some errors, because libraries aren't installed yet:

``` console
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
C_WRAP_LIB
    linked by target "MulleObjCClionDemo" in directory /home/mulle-kybernetik-tv/CLionProjects/myproject
FOUNDATION_WRAP_LIB
    linked by target "MulleObjCClionDemo" in directory /home/mulle-kybernetik-tv/CLionProjects/myproject
FOUNDATION_WRAP_STARTUP_LIB
    linked by target "MulleObjCClionDemo" in directory /home/mulle-kybernetik-tv/CLionProjects/myproject

CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
```

## 2. Get mulle-objc Foundation libraries

To get things to compile you need the [Foundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/Foundation) repackaged in a special format and placed
into a folder `usr` in your project directory. Check the "FoundationWrap" release page for possibly pre-packaged release archives.
Otherwise, here is how to build and repackage the Foundation:

### mulle-objc version 0.20

For this to work you need to repackage all the Objective-c libraries as well as mulle-sprintf of [Foundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/Foundation) into 
**FoundationWrap**. Place the `Foundation-startup`, `mulle-atinit`, `mulle-atexit` libraries into **FoundationWrap-startup**. Combine all the remaining
C files into a **c-wrap** library. Create a directory `usr/include` and copy all the headers recursively there. Create a directory `usr/lib` and copy the three
libraries there.


### mulle-objc version 0.21 (Future as of 1.2022) and beyond

Use [FoundationWrap](//github.com/MulleFoundation/FoundationWrap) to create a directory `usr` in your project with 
all the required headers and libraries.

Assuming your project is called "myproject" and has been placed into `~/CLionProjects`.

```
mulle-sde install --debug --prefix ~/CLionProjects/myproject/usr https://github.com/MulleFoundation/FoundationWrap
```

## 3. Reload CMake caches 

CLion's cmake cache needs to be resetted to work with the new configuration. Chose "Tools / Cmake / Reset Cache and Reload Project"
